## Requested Reading

- Zhang, L., Yang, G., & Stadie, B. C. (2021). World Model as a Graph: Learning Latent Landmarks for Planning. ICML. [Paper](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/zhang21x.html).
  Role: user-requested graph-construction candidate (L3P). Learns landmarks in a Euclidean latent space and plans using directed reachability weights. Assess landmark compression separately from graph fidelity.

- Bae, J., Park, K., & Lee, Y. (2024). TLDR: Unsupervised Goal-Conditioned RL via Temporal Distance-Aware Representations. CoRL. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08464).
  Role: user-requested exploration/representation candidate. Does not itself extract an explicit graph. Its symmetric latent distance motivates separate tests of branching distortion and directional travel costs.

- Gao, P., & Ganguli, S. (2015). On simplicity and complexity in the brave new world of large-scale neuroscience. Current Opinion in Neurobiology. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conb.2015.04.003  
  Role: **user-identified first priority for the environment/measure work.** Neural task complexity (NTC) bounds representational dimensionality using the volume of the task-parameter manifold and the neural correlation length. The volume-over-correlation-volume construction is the closest existing template for a curvature-like GeoMem task index, but GeoMem should define its index on the controlled task and observation process rather than on a trained neural representation.

- Gao, P., Trautmann, E., Yu, B. M., Santhanam, G., Ryu, S., Shenoy, K. V., & Ganguli, S. (2017). A theory of multineuronal dimensionality, dynamics and measurement. bioRxiv. https://doi.org/10.1101/214262  
  Role: **user-identified technical follow-up for NTC**, including correlation-volume formulas and sampling predictions. Useful for separating intrinsic task complexity from apparent dimensionality caused by a particular model or recording.

- George, D., et al. (2024). Space is a latent sequence: A theory of the hippocampus. Science Advances. https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adm8470
  Role: sequence-first account in which spatial structure is learned from sensory sequences; a direct contrast to GeoMem's hypothesis that sequence memory is selected only in some geometry-observation regimes.

- Cueva, C. J., & Wei, X.-X. (2018). Emergence of grid-like representations by training recurrent neural networks to perform spatial localization. ICLR 2018. https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1803.07770
  Role: canonical Euclidean RNN path-integration baseline: velocity-driven localization yields grid-, border-, and band-like units. The student's environments should reproduce this regime before interpreting curvature-dependent changes.

- Wang, Z., Di Tullio, R. W., Rooke, S., & Balasubramanian, V. (2024). Time Makes Space: Emergence of Place Fields in Networks Encoding Temporally Continuous Sensory Experiences. NeurIPS 2024. https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05798
  Role: temporally continuous masked sensory reconstruction yields place-like fields, remapping, drift, and continual recall without spatial supervision. It motivates sensory continuity, room identity, revisit structure, and masking/cue loss as explicit environment axes.

- Ritter, L., & Chadwick, A. (2025). Efficient Working Memory Maintenance via High-Dimensional Rotational Dynamics. bioRxiv (preprint, v1). https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.09.08.674838
  Role: efficient, noise-robust working-memory solutions develop high-dimensional rotational dynamics, with evidence in monkey prefrontal cortex. A useful contrast for GeoMem: dynamic recurrent maintenance can be selected by efficiency constraints even without a navigation-specific sequence mechanism.

## AI Recommendations

- Wang, T., Torralba, A., Isola, P., & Zhang, A. (2023). Optimal Goal-Reaching Reinforcement Learning via Quasimetric Learning. ICML. [Paper](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/wang23al.html).
  Role: candidate approach for directed goal-reaching costs. Asymmetry is distinct from curvature; theoretical recovery claims must retain the paper's assumptions.

- Nickel, M., & Kiela, D. (2017). Poincare Embeddings for Learning Hierarchical Representations. NeurIPS. [Paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2017/hash/59dfa2df42d9e3d41f5b02bfc32229dd-Abstract.html).
  Role: geometric alternative for compact hierarchical representations. Does not by itself establish transition fidelity or memory sufficiency for control.

- Ollivier, Y. (2009). Ricci curvature of Markov chains on metric spaces. Journal of Functional Analysis. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfa.2008.11.001  
  Role: principled local curvature for stochastic transition kernels, defined by contraction or expansion of nearby one-step distributions in Wasserstein distance. A strong candidate diagnostic for environments, but it must be tested against GeoMem's commutativity, transition ambiguity, and policy ambiguity rather than assumed to predict memory demand by itself.

- Zhang, H., Rich, P. D., Lee, A. K., & Sharpee, T. O. (2023). Hippocampal spatial representations exhibit a hyperbolic geometry that expands with experience. Nature Neuroscience. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-022-01212-4  
  Role: empirical motivation for negative curvature and hierarchical/tree-like codes. Especially relevant because the paper explicitly connects hyperbolic noncommutativity to spike order, but its inferred representational curvature is not yet a task-intrinsic classifier.

- Urdapilleta, E., Troiani, F., Stella, F., & Treves, A. (2015). Can rodents conceive hyperbolic spaces? Journal of the Royal Society Interface. https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2014.1214  
  Role: key counterexample and environment-design guide: grid-like organization can remain locally viable in negatively curved space when grid scale is small relative to curvature radius. Motivates sweeping the dimensionless path-length/curvature-radius ratio instead of treating Euclidean and hyperbolic tasks as a binary contrast.

- Hardcastle, K., Ganguli, S., & Giocomo, L. M. (2015). Environmental boundaries as an error correction mechanism for grid cells. Neuron. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2015.03.039  
  Role: shows how boundaries and sensory correction interact with path integration. It motivates treating boundary conditions and cue availability as independent environment factors, not as incidental implementation details.
